[introduction]
= Introduction
The coderadar server is a tool for continuous source code analysis. To start analysis of your project,
you only have to provide a few configuration parameters and let coderadar do the work. This document
describes the REST API of the coderadar server.

= Resources

== Project
A project defines some metadata about the project you want coderadar to analyze. With a project resource
and its sub-resources you provide coderadar with the information it needs to analyze the source code.

=== Listing Projects
TODO

=== Creating a Project

==== Request
include::{snippets}/projects/post/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/post/request-fields.adoc[]

==== Response
include::{snippets}/projects/post/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/post/links.adoc[]

=== Updating a Project
TODO

=== Deleting a Project
TODO

== File Patterns
A file pattern describes a set of files within a project's code base. Each project can have several file patterns
defined, each matching a set of files that may be handled differently by coderadar during analysis.

=== Listing a Project's File Patterns

==== Request
include::{snippets}/filepatterns/get/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response
include::{snippets}/filepatterns/get/http-response.adoc[]

=== Setting a Project's File Patterns
You can only set all File Patterns of a project at once.

==== Request
include::{snippets}/filepatterns/post/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/filepatterns/post/request-fields.adoc[]

==== Response
include::{snippets}/filepatterns/post/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/filepatterns/post/links.adoc[]

= Error Handling

== Successful Requests
Successful requests return a response with HTTP status 200 (OK) and contain a JSON structure in the response
body if applicable.

== Validation Errors
POST requests against the coderadar API usually expect a JSON structure in the request body. If the JSON structure
contains values that are invalid, the API returns a response with HTTP status 400 (bad request) that contains
an error JSON structure object that looks like this:

include::{snippets}/projects/post/error400/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/post/error400/response-fields.adoc[]

== General Errors
If some unexpected error occurs during the processing of a request, the API returns a response with HTTP status 500
(internal server error).
