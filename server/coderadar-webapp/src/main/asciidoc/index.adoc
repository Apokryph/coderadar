[introduction]
= Introduction
The coderadar server is a tool for continuous source code analysis. To start analysis of your project,
you only have to provide a few configuration parameters and let coderadar do the work. This document
describes the REST API of the coderadar server.

= Resources

== Project
A project resource defines some metadata about the project you want coderadar to analyze.
The coderadar API allows to list, create, update and delete projects as well as some sub-resources
of projects.

=== Listing projects

=== Creating a project
==== Request
include::{snippets}/projects/post/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/post/request-fields.adoc[]
==== Response
include::{snippets}/projects/post/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/post/links.adoc[]

=== Updating a project

=== Deleting a project

= Error Handling

== Successful Requests
Successful requests return a response with HTTP status 200 (OK) and contain a JSON structure in the response
body if applicable.

== Validation Errors
POST requests against the coderadar API usually expect a JSON structure in the request body. If the JSON structure
contains values that are invalid, the API returns a response with HTTP status 400 (bad request) that contains
an error JSON structure object that looks like this:

include::{snippets}/projects/post/error400/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/post/error400/response-fields.adoc[]

== General Errors
If some unexpected error occurs during the processing of a request, the API returns a response with HTTP status 500
(internal server error).
