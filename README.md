# coderadar

coderadar aims to be a continuous source code analysis tool. Point coderadar at your version control system and it analyzes your code for you.

## coderadar server
The coderadar server is a web application that provides a REST API to interact with it. Via the REST API, you can configure your project and retrieve source code metrics for each commit in your version control system.
